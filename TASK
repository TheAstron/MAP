Make loop back with cable between UART2_TXD and UART2_RXD and send and receive data .Both data should be same. Identify which driver are going to be used , DTS changes and way to validate from user space.
&uart2 {
             status = "okay";
             pinctrl-names = "default";
             pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_pins>;
};
 
&am33xx_pinmux {
             uart2_pins: pinmux_uart2_pins {
                            pinctrl-single,pins = <
                                          AM33XX_PADCONF(AM335X_PIN_SPI0_D0, PIN_OUTPUT, MUX_MODE1)
